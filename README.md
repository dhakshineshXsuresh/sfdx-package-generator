- Setup your project using **SFDX: Create Project with Manifest** command and authorize it using **SFDX: Authorize an Org command**. Skip this step if already done.
For more details refer [Org Development Model with VS Code] (https://forcedotcom.github.io/salesforcedx-vscode/articles/user-guide/org-development-model). 
- Open the command palette (press Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Linux, or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and run **SFDX Package.xml Generator: Choose Metadata Components** command.
- In Choose Metadata Components for Package.xml page, select the Metadata you need and click on **Update Package.xml** button.
- Package.xml file opens up with the selected metadata components.
- Open the command palette (press Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows or Linux, or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) and run **SFDX: Retrieve Source in Manifest from Org**
- **Select All** button selects all the metadata components except Reports, Dashboards, Email Templates and Documents.
- If you don't want to modify the existing package.xml file & only want the generated xml content, click on **Copy to Clipboard** button. This copies the formatted package.xml contents to clipboard which can be pasted somewhere else.
